<h1 align="center"> LED Circuit </h1>


# *The circuit built is simple it consists of:*

-  A bread board 
-  LED Lights 
-  330  Ω Resistors
-  10K Ω Resistors
-  A coin cell battery 
-  Some solid core wires 
-  Raspberry Pi Board 
-  Micro USB cable 
-  A couple of buttons

# *Codes function (Task 1-4)*

All the tasks were simple up untill task 4 where it got really challenging.

The program enables the buttons to turn on the LED lights in different modes.

if Button 1 was pressed once the LED sequence G -> Y -> R should occur 

if Button 1 was pressed twice it would change the direction of the sequence, for example :

button 1 was  pressed while the sequence was on the Yellow LED the Green LED would light back on.

if Button 2 was pressed the LED sequence R -> Y -> G
 

# *Task 5* 

The two Task 5 files are programs that output the correct amount of volts, resistance, serial resistance and current and the code informs you if they passed the test or not.
